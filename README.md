# face-recognition-attendance-system

The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring 
system for educational institution to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into
more efficient and effective as compared to before.

The current old systemhas a lot of ambiguity that can cause inaccurate and
inefficient attendance taking. Many problems arise when the authority is unable to enforce 
the regulation that exist in the old system. The technology working behind will be
the face recognition system. The human face is one of the natural traits that can uniquely
identify an individual.

Therefore, it is used to trace identity as the possibilities for a face to deviate or being
duplicated is low. In this project, face databases will be created to pump data into the 
recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance taking session, faces will be compared against
the database to seek for identity. When an individual is identified, its attendance will be taken 
down automatically saving necessary information into an excel sheet in csv format.
